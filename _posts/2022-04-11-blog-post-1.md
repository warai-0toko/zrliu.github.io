The sparse signal recovery requires to solve the following optimization problem:

$$
\begin{aligned}
&\min ||x||_0 \\ 
& \text{s.t.} Ax=y 
\end{aligned}
$$

where $x\in\mathbb{R}^m, y\in\mathbb{R}^n, \text{and }A\in\mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$.
In practice, x usually means the underlying true signal and y means the observed signal.
